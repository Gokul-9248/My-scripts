# Docsify Setup Instructions
## Introduction
Docsify is a lightweight documentation site generator that helps you create beautiful and interactive websites using just Markdown files. It does not generate static HTML files but loads and renders Markdown dynamically.

---

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (v18 or later)
2. **npm** (v10 or later)
To check the versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v


---

Installation

Install Docsify globally using npm:

npm install -g docsify-cli


---

Creating a New Documentation Site

1. Initialize a new project:

docsify init ./docs

This will create a docs directory with the following structure:

docs/
├── index.html
└── README.md


2. Edit the README.md: Add your content here. This will be the homepage of your Docsify site.




---

Starting the Server

Run the Docsify server to preview your site:

docsify serve docs

By default, the server runs on http://localhost:3000. If you want to use a different port:

docsify serve docs --port <desired-port>


---

Deployment Instructions

To deploy your Docsify site:

1. Using GitHub Pages:

Commit and push the docs folder to your GitHub repository.

Go to your repository settings and enable GitHub Pages with the docs directory as the source.



2. Using a Web Server:

Copy the contents of the docs folder to your web server's root directory.



3. Using Docker:

Create a Dockerfile for the Docsify project.

Build and run a Docker container exposing the desired port.

Tips and Best Practices

1. Customizing Sidebar and Navbar:

Create _sidebar.md and _navbar.md files in the docs directory for additional navigation customization.



2. Using Plugins:

Enhance your Docsify site by adding plugins. For example, search functionality:

<script>
  window.$docsify = {
    search: 'auto'
  }
</script>



3. Markdown Tips:

Use Markdown syntax for tables, images, and links for a better user experience.



4. Check the Docsify Documentation:

Visit Docsify's official documentation for advanced customization.
